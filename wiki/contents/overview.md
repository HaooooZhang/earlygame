### How does this mod play?

Well, if you've used _No Tree Punching_ and/or _Natural Progression_, you would feel familiar with how this mod will play. Otherwise, here's a brief description of the gameplay.

#### Sticks and stones everywhere.

You spawn in the new world, and you immediately see a lot of rocks and sticks around you. They naturally spawn on the surface as the world is being generated. You can use them, along with flint that you get from gravel or dirt, to get started on your journey.

#### Use flint to craft makeshift tools.

After getting flint, you can use it on top of any stone material to knap it. Starting from a knife, you can craft makeshift tools! You can also make flint shards by using a knife on a rock block while sneaking. Crafting guide can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JayCeeCreates/earlygame/wiki/Recipes).

#### You need the right tools to do the job.

We removed the most important mechanic on early game Minecraft: punching wood. You accumulate damage as you continue, so best craft a proper tool to get the job done. Of course, you wouldn't be dumb enough to keep punching stone, would ya?

#### There's a new way to chop wood.

You don't have to craft a log into planks. Use your axe and interact with the wood block while sneaking to chop it, and it will produce 2 to 4 planks. Do the same on the planks, and it will provide you with 1 or 2 sticks. If you use a saw, it will surely provide you the maximum amount.

#### Make use of copper.

Wooden and stone tools are disabled, and copper tools are born. Copper tools are tiered exactly like the stone tools. This way, copper tools would feel like they actually have a use in early game other than just a substitute for iron. Oh, and copper armor as well. The set is durable enough to be an early game armor. You can find copper ores on the same level as iron ores.

#### You are in control.

Some values of the mod are configurable. From making ground blocks slower to dig to the chance of taking damage from punching wood, either you make your experience basic or literally virtually impossible. It's all up to you.
