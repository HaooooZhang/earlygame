### What does this mod contain?

Not too much, but not too little. Here is the list.

#### Blocks

**Cobblestone variants**

Andesite, diorite, and granite cobblestones are available. They basically serve the same purpose as a regular cobblestone. You can craft them using their respective loose rocks.

* Andesite Cobblestone
* Diorite Cobblestone
* Granite Cobblestone

**Copper ore and block (1.16)**

Copper is as common as iron. You can mine a copper ore using just a makeshift pickaxe. Smelt a copper ore and you'll get an ingot. Combine all nine of them and you'll get a block. Simple logic.

* Copper Ore
* Copper Block

#### Items

**Rocks**

These are found lying around the world. You can collect them using either the left or right mouse button, doesn't matter which. These rocks are dropped by mining a stone variant, then can be used to craft cobblestone.

* Stone Rock
* Andesite Rock
* Diorite Rock
* Granite Rock
* Sandstone Rock
* Red Sandstone Rock

**Plant fiber and lashing**

Plant fibers can be obtained by cutting the grass using a knife. Combine four of them to make a lashing, which is important for crafting makeshift tools.

* Plant Fiber
* Lashing

**Flint shards**

These are obtained by knapping flint on any stone material (interacting with the top of the stone while holding flint). These can be used to craft flint tools.

**Copper ingots (1.16) and nuggets**

The copper ingot is a product of smelted copper ore and can be used to craft a variety of tools and armor. An ingot can be turned into 9 nuggets and vice versa.

* Copper Ingot
* Copper Nugget

#### Tools

**Flint tools**

These are makeshift tools that you make using sticks, flint shards, and some lashing. These guys have very little durability, but it is enough to provide you a decent start for your early game progression, so use them while you still can.

* Flint Pickaxe
* Flint Axe
* Flint Knife
* Flint Saw

**Primitive tools**

Primitive tools are those that are made of pure sticks and lashings. They serve as early game counterparts of flint and steel and bow and arrow, respectively. The fire starter behaves like a flint and steel, but there's a random chance that the fire will actually start. Using a slingshot is the same as using a bow, but you use any type of rock as ammo.

* Fire Starter
* Slingshot

**Copper tools**

Copper tools are tiered exactly with the stone tools and thus cannot be used to mine diamonds, of course. Copper was introduced officially in a 1.17 snapshot, but as of this writing, there are no tools and weapons present for the copper variant yet.

* Copper Sword
* Copper Knife
* Copper Shovel
* Copper Pickaxe
* Copper Axe
* Copper Saw
* Copper Hoe

**Copper armor**

Copper armor is set to be stronger than golden armor but weaker than iron armor. Just the right balance for the early game.

* Copper Helmet _(Durability: 121; Protection: +2 Armor)_
* Copper Breastplate _(Durability: 176; Protection: +5 Armor)_
* Copper Leggings _(Durability: 165; Protection: +4 Armor)_
* Copper Boots _(Durability: 143; Protection: +1 Armor)_

**Vanilla materials**

Knives and saws are new tools added for vanilla materials as well. They basically have the same crafting recipes. Knives are weaker versions of swords, but they have a faster swing cooldown. Additionally, it can be used for breaking grass to collect plant fiber used for crafting lashing. Saws are alternatives to axes, but using them for chopping wood will surely yield you the maximum amount of drop.

* Iron Knife
* Iron Saw
* Golden Knife
* Golden Saw
* Diamond Knife
* Diamond Saw
* Netherite Knife
* Netherite Saw
