### Frequently Asked Questions <span style="font-size: 6pt; font-weight: normal">Okay, maybe not that frequently asked but you get the point-</span>

#### Why did you make this mod?

When I started developing EarlyGame, there hasn't been any mod that enables early game realism in the Fabric mod database. Not even [No Tree Punching](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching) and [Natural Progression](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natural-progressions)--two Forge mods that I really like. Leveraging my skills in Java from my college degree, I thought, "Fine. I'll do it myself." This also serves as my learning experience, as I am no professional programmer by any means. You gotta learn something new everyday.

This mod may bear some similarities with the two aforementioned mods, but I always try to put a different taste. As always, your contributions will help the development of this mod, so thanks in advance!

#### Is there any particular roadmap? Where is this leading to?

I've always seen it as some sort of a personal/hobby project, but it's also one that I would like everyone to enjoy. That being said, I don't really have a particular roadmap as to where this is going, but I do have a vision for this and many other projects that may or may not come. Because of the open source nature of the mod, **EarlyGame is a project with effort from the community** who loves Minecraft and realism mods, and collaboration is one way to produce progress.

#### Is it coming for \*insert Minecraft version here\*?

I'll try my best to port it to later versions, but if you are willing to do so, feel free! If you are done, open up a pull request and I'll get to work on it.

#### May I use this in my modpack?

Sure thing! Give credit where it's due~

#### Forge version?

Unnecessary. Use either of the two mods I mentioned above.
